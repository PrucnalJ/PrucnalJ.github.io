                    Embarking on the journey of building a personal website has been a rewarding and educational experience. Throughout this project, I have honed my skills in HTML and CSS, two foundational technologies for web development. Initially, I started with the basics of HTML, learning how to structure web pages with elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and links. As I progressed, I delved into CSS, exploring how to style and layout web pages to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
                    Throughout this journey, I encountered challenges that pushed me to learn and adapt. Debugging code and troubleshooting layout issues taught me how to think critically and solve problems efficiently. As I experimented with different design elements and layouts, I gained a deeper understanding of responsive design, ensuring that my website looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
